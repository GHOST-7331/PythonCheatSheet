`#!/bin/python3` is a shebang line that tells the operating system to use the Python 3 interpreter located at `/bin/python3` to run the script.

`if __name__ == "__main__"` ensures that the block of code it controls runs only when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module.

`def function():` is the syntax for defining a function in Python.

`name = 'ghost'` assigns the value `'ghost'` to the variable `name`.

`print(name)` will output the value `'ghost'` to the terminal.

`name, name_length = "ghost", 5` assigns the value `'ghost'` to the variable `name` and the value `5` to the variable `name_length`.

`name_length = "4"` assigns the string value `"4"` to the variable `name_length`.
